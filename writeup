Lab05: Context Switching
<PUT NAMES HERE>

Part 1: 5

Q1. How many timers do you use in lab4? Is there any difference if you use 1 
    timer and 2 timers for scheduling? 

Q2. Suppose there are task1 and task2, task1 has higher priority than task2, by
    manual scheduling what will happen if task1 needs to be executed while task2

Q4. What is SysTick and PendSV? 

Q5. What context contents are saved during a context switch, by hardware or by

Q6. Why? Why can't a C program conduct a context switch? 

Q7. What are the potential problems to use SysTick to conduct context switching?

Part 3: 3

Q8. What are the advantages of PendSV over SysTick to invoke a context switching? 

Q9. Think about how you can make the scheduling easier than manual scheduling by 
    doing a context switching?
